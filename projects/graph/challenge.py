# Given an object/dictionary with keys and values that consist of both strings and integers, design an algorithm to calculate
# and return the sum of all of the numeric values.
# For example, given the following object/dictionary as input:
sum_values ={
  "cat": "bob", #no
  "dog": 23, #23
  19: 18, #18
  90: "fish"#no
}
# Your algorithm should return 41, the sum of the values 23 and 18.
# You may use whatever programming language youâ€™d like.
# Verbalize your thought process as much as possible before writing any code. Run through the UPER problem solving framework while going through your thought process.
sum_numbers = 0
for value in sum_values.values():
    if type(value) == int:
        sum_numbers += value

print(sum_numbers)
